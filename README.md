# photoshoot
Generate a GIF of canon balls that shoot around and slowly fall in place to form an image.

The project is inspired by [this video](https://youtu.be/lS_qeBy3aQI?si=0QOkNiy3eRM54eK1) (especially the end).

In the current state, `photoshoot` is completely unoptimizied and slow.
Also, for now there is no CLI, you have to edit the [main.rs](./src/main.rs) code to customize for your purposes.
